# Horizon Operator Example Edge Service

## Preconditions for Developing Your Own Service

1. If you have not already done so, complete the steps in this section:

  - [Preconditions for Using the Operator Example Edge Service](README.md#preconditions)
  
## <a id=using-operator-pattern></a> Using the Operator Example Edge Service with Deployment Pattern

1. To execute the `hzn` commands below, `exec` inside the agent container
```bash
kubectl exec -it agent-<agent-pod-id> -n openhorizon-agent /bin/bash
```

2. Register your edge node with Horizon to use the `ibm.operator` pattern:

```bash
hzn register -p IBM/pattern-ibm.operator -s ibm.operator --serviceorg IBM
```
 - **Note**: using the `-s` flag with the `hzn register` command will cause Horizon to wait until agreements are formed and the service is running on your edge node to exit, or alert you of any errors encountered during the registration process. 

3. Veryfy that the `simple-operator` deployment is up and runing:
```bash 
kubectl get pod -n openhorizon-agent
```

- If everything deployed correctly you will see the operator pod in addition to three `example-ibmserviceoperator` pods running similar to following output
```bash 
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
agent-6d8b8895f-bpwm9                         1/1     Running   0          2d21h
example-ibmserviceoperator-7d6849c487-5pmcb   1/1     Running   0          88s
example-ibmserviceoperator-7d6849c487-926xt   1/1     Running   0          88s
example-ibmserviceoperator-7d6849c487-j9z58   1/1     Running   0          88s
simple-operator-5cd47878fc-gjcl6              1/1     Running   0          96s
```

4. Verify that the operator is running successfully by checking its logs:
```bash
kubectl logs simple-operator-<op-id> -n openhorizon-agent
```

- If the operator is opperating correctly the logs should look similar to the following output:
```bash
root@gormand1:~# kubectl logs simple-operator-5cd47878fc-gjcl6 -n openhorizon-agent

```

5. Verify that the operator sucessfully deployed the `ibm.helloworld` service and the environment variables were passed into the pod:
```bash
kubectl logs example-ibmserviceoperator-<ex-op-id> -n openhorizon-agent
```

- if the environment variables were received by the worker pods the ouput should look similar to the following:
```bash
kubectl logs example-ibmserviceoperator-<ex-op-id> -n openhorizon-agent
tfine-cluster-apollo1 says: Hello from the cluster!!!
tfine-cluster-apollo1 says: Hello from the cluster!!!
tfine-cluster-apollo1 says: Hello from the cluster!!!
```

6. Unregister your edge node (which will also stop the myhelloworld service):
```bash
hzn unregister -f
```
