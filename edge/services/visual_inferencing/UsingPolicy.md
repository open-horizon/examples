## <a id=preconditions></a> Preconditions for Using the Operator Example Edge Service

If you haven't done so already, you must do these steps before proceeding with the operator example:

1. Install the Horizon management hub (exchange and agbot).

2. Install the Horizon agent on your edge cluster and configure it to point to your Horizon exchange.

3. As part of the management hub installation process a file called `agent-install.cfg` was created that contains the values for `HZN_ORG_ID` and the exchange and css URL values. Locate this file and set those environment variables in your shell now:

```bash
eval export $(cat agent-install.cfg)
```

 - **Note**: if for some reason you disconnected from ssh or your command line closes, run the above command again to set the required environment variables.

4. In addition to the file above, an API key associated with your Horizon instance would have been created, set the exchange user credentials, and verify them:

```bash
export HZN_EXCHANGE_USER_AUTH=iamapikey:<horizon-API-key>
hzn exchange user list
```

5. Choose an ID and token for your edge node, create it, and verify it:

```bash
export HZN_EXCHANGE_NODE_AUTH="<choose-any-node-id>:<choose-any-node-token>"
hzn exchange node create -n $HZN_EXCHANGE_NODE_AUTH
hzn exchange node confirm
```

6. If you have not done so already, unregister your node before moving on:

 ```bash
hzn unregister -f
```

## <a id=using-operator-policy></a> Using the Operator Example Edge Service with Deployment Policy

In the following steps you will deploy the `ibm.operator` to your edge cluster. This operator will then create a pod running the `ibm.helloworld` service.

1. Start a shell inside the agent container to execute `hzn` commands:

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n openhorizon-agent agent-<agent-pod-id> -- /bin/bash
```

2. Get the required node policy file on your edge cluster:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-horizon/examples/master/edge/services/operator/simple-operator/deploy/horizon/node.policy.json
```

- Below is the `node_policy.json` file you obtained in the step above:

```json
{
  "properties": [
    { "name": "openhorizon.service", "value": "ibm.operator" }
  ],
  "constraints": [
  ]
}
```

- It provides one value for `properties` (`openhorizon.service`), that will effect which services get deployed to this edge node, and states no `constraints`.

3. Register your Node Policy with this policy

```bash
hzn register --policy node.policy.json
```

4. When the registration completes, use the following command to review the Node Policy:

```bash
hzn policy list
```

5. The edge device will make an agreement with one of the Horizon agreement bots (this typically takes about 15 seconds). Repeatedly query the agreements of this device until the `agreement_finalized_time` and `agreement_execution_start_time` fields are filled in:

```bash
hzn agreement list
```

- Below is the `service.policy.json` that was published into the Exchange when the example operator was published:

```json
{
    "properties": [],
    "constraints": [
        "openhorizon.arch == amd64"
    ]
}
```

- Below is the example `deployment.policy.json` that has been published into the Exchange as part of the example operator:

```json
{
  "mycluster/ibm.operator_1.0.0": {
    "owner": "mycluster/operator1",
    "label": "ibm.operator Deployment Policy",
    "description": "A super-simple sample Horizon Deployment Policy",
    "service": {
      "name": "ibm.operator",
      "org": "mycluster",
      "arch": "*",
      "serviceVersions": [
        {
          "version": "1.0.0",
          "priority": {},
          "upgradePolicy": {}
        }
      ],
      "nodeHealth": {}
    },
    "constraints": [
      "openhorizon.service == ibm.operator"
    ],
    "userInput": [
      {
        "serviceOrgid": "mycluster",
        "serviceUrl": "ibm.operator",
        "serviceVersionRange": "[0.0.0,INFINITY)",
        "inputs": [
          {
            "name": "HW_WHO",
            "value": "from the cluster!"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "created": "2020-05-21T17:18:34.956Z[UTC]",
    "lastUpdated": "2020-05-21T19:50:56.937Z[UTC]"
  }
}
```

6. Exit the agent container shell so you can run other `kubectl` commands:

```bash
exit
```

7. Verify that the `simple-operator` deployment is up and running:

```bash
kubectl get pod -n openhorizon-agent
```

- If everything deployed correctly you will see the operator pod in addition to the `example-ibmserviceoperator` pod running similar to following output:

```bash
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
agent-6d8b8895f-bpwm9                         1/1     Running   0          2d21h
example-ibmserviceoperator-7d6849c487-5pmcb   1/1     Running   0          88s
simple-operator-5cd47878fc-gjcl6              1/1     Running   0          96s
```

8. Verify that the operator is running successfully by checking its logs:

```bash
kubectl logs simple-operator-<op-id> -n openhorizon-agent
```

- If the operator is operating correctly, the logs should look similar to the following output:

```bash
root@gormand1:~# kubectl logs simple-operator-5cd47878fc-gjcl6 -n openhorizon-agent

```

9. Verify that the operator successfully deployed the `ibm.helloworld` service and the environment variables were passed into the pod:

```bash
kubectl logs example-ibmserviceoperator-<ex-op-id> -n openhorizon-agent
```

- if the environment variables were received by the worker pods the output should look similar to the following:

```bash
kubectl logs example-ibmserviceoperator-<ex-op-id> -n openhorizon-agent
tfine-cluster-apollo1 says: Hello from the cluster!!!
tfine-cluster-apollo1 says: Hello from the cluster!!!
tfine-cluster-apollo1 says: Hello from the cluster!!!
```

10. Unregister your edge node (which will also stop the operator and helloworld service):

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n openhorizon-agent agent-<agent-pod-id> -- hzn unregister -f
```
