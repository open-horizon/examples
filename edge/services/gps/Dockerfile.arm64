# Horizon GPS Location Service: gps
#
# This server provides REST access to gps receiver location and satellite data
# (or gps location estimated from the IP address if hardware is not available).
#
# More precise documentation of the behavior of this container may be found
# in the src/main.go source code.
#
# To build this server container, run the following command in this directory:
#   $ make
#
# Written by Glen Darling, November 2016.
# Updated to 2-stage build, and modified to target arm64v8, May 2019.



# Build stage 0: Go compilation
