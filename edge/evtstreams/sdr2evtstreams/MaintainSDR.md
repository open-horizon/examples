# Process for the Horizon Development Team to Make Updates to the SDR To IBM Event Streams Service

The instructions for the open-horizon developers that are maintaining this example code are:

- Perform the steps in the [README.md Preconditions](README.md#preconditions) section, **except**:
    - export `HZN_EXCHANGE_URL` to the staging instance
    - Do **not** copy the sdr2evtstreams directory (use the git files in this directory instead)
    - export `HZN_EXCHANGE_USER_AUTH` to your credentials in the IBM org
- Make whatever code changes are necessary
- Increment `SERVICE_VERSION` in `horizon/hzn.json`
- Make `~/.hzn/keys/service.private.key` and `~/.hzn/keys/service.public.pem` actually be symbolic links to the common keys we use to sign all of our examples.
- Build, test, and publish for all architectures:
```
make publish-all-arches
```
Note: building all architectures works on mac os x, and can be made to work on ubuntu via: http://wiki.micromint.com/index.php/Debian_ARM_Cross-compile , https://wiki.debian.org/QemuUserEmulation
